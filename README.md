# 🏠 Personal Homepage – devXsameer

A modern, responsive **developer portfolio homepage** built from scratch as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.  
While the provided design was minimal, I decided to create my **own unique and professional layout** — blending accessibility, responsiveness, and dark-themed aesthetics.
